# requirements.txt for The Reward Alchemist

# ======================================================================
# == !! IMPORTANT INSTALLATION ORDER !! ==
# ======================================================================
# 1. Install PyTorch FIRST using the official command for your system:
#    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#    (Select OS, pip, Python, CPU/CUDA)
#
# 2. Install PyTorch Geometric packages SECOND, matching your PyTorch version:
#    https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html
#    (This often involves installing torch-scatter, torch-sparse first)
#
# 3. ONLY AFTER completing steps 1 & 2 successfully, run:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
